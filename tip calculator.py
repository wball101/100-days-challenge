#Tip Calculator
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? \n$"))
tip = float(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 15, or 20? \n"))
people = float(input("How many people to split the bill? \n"))
before_tip = (bill / people)

total_per_person = round((before_tip + (bill/ people) * (tip/100)) , 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${total_per_person}")
